## Codexio Dev Camp

'Sharing is carrying' has always been our leitmotif. We believe that the right people don't just appear in the middle of your life. You need to grow up with them from the beginning. That's why we want to invest time and energy into building people's knowledge and skills.

Codexio Dev Camp is three months internship programme where people with minimal knowledge in the beginning results into masters in the end.
